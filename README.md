# Cinder-WMFMovieWriter
Simple movie recorder for Cinder using the Windows Media foundation.

This clocks was made by hacking [Tutorial: Using the Sink Writer to Encode Video](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff819477(v=vs.85).aspx). IT is not meant to be seen as a professional library nor will I be giving any kind of support.

For now it just writes h264 and WMV3 files, but you can modified it to suit your needs.
